emp1, Employee emp2)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(emp1, emp2))
        {
            return true;
        }

        if(ReferenceEquals(emp1, null)) || (ReferenceEquals(emp2, null)))
        {
            return false;
        }

        return emp1.Id == emp2.Id;
    }

    // overload the "!=" operator for comparisons based on Id(ReferenceEquals(emp1, null) || ReferenceEquals(emp2, null)))
        {
            return false;
        }

        return emp1.Id == emp2.Id;
    }

    // overload the "!=" operator by using the previously defined "=="
    public static bool operator !=(Employee emp1, Employee emp2)
    {
        return !(emp1 == emp2);
    }
}
```

To test this overloaded operator, we can create two Employee objects and compare them:

```
Employee emp1 = new Employee { Id = 1, FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };
Employee emp2 = new Employee { Id = 2, FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe" };

Console.WriteLine("Are emp1 and emp2 equal? " + (emp1 == emp2)); // false

Employee emp3 = new Employee { Id = 1, FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };

Console.WriteLine("Are emp1 and emp3 equal? " + (emp1 == emp3)); // true
```

The output of this code will be:

```
Are emp1 and emp2 equal? False
Are emp1 and emp3 equal? True
```

Note that the comparison with "emp1" and "emp2" returns false because they have different Ids, while the comparison with "emp1" and "emp3" returns true because they have the same Id.
