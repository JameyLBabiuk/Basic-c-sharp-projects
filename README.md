# Car Insurance

The given project is a web application designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which replicates the functionalities of a car insurance website. It enables users to provide policy details and generates a price estimate using predetermined algorithms. Additionally, there is an administrative section where authorized personnel can access a comprehensive list of all issued insurance quotes.

# IQuittable

IQuittable illustrates the concept of an Interface and demonstrates how Polymorphism works. Essentially, it derives the point home on an object being an interface type if it implements that specific interface.
