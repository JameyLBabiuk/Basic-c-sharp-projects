C# is an object orientated programming language that will be used to create virtually any programs

# Car Insurance

The given project is a web application designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which replicates the functionalities of a car insurance website. It enables users to provide policy details and generates a price estimate using predetermined algorithms. Additionally, there is an administrative section where authorized personnel can access a comprehensive list of all issued insurance quotes.

# IQuittable

IQuittable illustrates the concept of an Interface and demonstrates how Polymorphism works. Essentially, it derives the point home on an object being an interface type if it implements that specific interface.

# Blackjack Game

# Operators
In this project, I depict  how overloaded operators function by comparing if employees are equal or not. These are the overloaded "!=" operator, and Overloaded "==" operator. Additionally, I also illustrated how the common Math Operators function. For example, Multiplication.

# Portfolio
The Portfolio website has my recent projects and in this section, I update it with the projects I have done in my C# projects. These include the Car Insurance, IQuittable, Blackjack Game, Polymorphism, & Operators.
